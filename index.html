was woke. When we try to understand the world around us and our very own bodies,
we are not simply observing reality <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">as it is</span></em>: we are constructing and utilizing
models, frameworks, and paradigms through which we perceive, analyze,
predict, and control our environment and the living beings among us. In
order to justify our beliefs, we draw from empirical data, reason through, and
hypothesize causation in relation to established insights; all within a plural and
intertwined historical project of knowledge building and perception shaping. If
we fail to admit that some perspectives are ineffective for understanding
and describing certain phenomena within a given context, we&#8217;re not helping
ourselves in this project; we are simply reinforcing the narratives that we&#8217;ve
grown to accept throughout history&#8212;potentially causing real harm along the
way.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   When it comes to the body, certain qualities that appear to live on a singular
dimension receive more nuanced and spectral recognition than complex and
multilayered topics. Take human age, for example&#8212;we think of &#8220;age as a series of
discrete categories, rather than as a continuous distribution. Categories such as infant,
baby, child,&#x00A0;&#x2026; adult, middle-age, old age, elderly would seem to be the most common,
but we can easily think of further subdivisions&#8221;&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-1007"></a>Giles and Reid <a 
href="#cite.0@Giles_2005">2005</a>, 393). We may
perceive of others as young or old in reference to our own age, or think in
                                                                         

                                                                         
terms of minor, adult, senior in legal settings, though we typically seem to
understand that transitioning from one category into another is merely a
crossing of an arbitrary mark. The underlying dimensional or gradual nature of
human aging is implied while we seem to value decimal divisions and lifecycle
categories.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   Thus, we can conceive of age through a variety of perspectives and representational
models, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, some properties like age, body
weight, and stature are typically not construed through a binary lens, in favor of
prototypical or normative structures. Whereas diversity of racialized, gendered, or
(dis)abled bodies seems much harder to grasp as sophisticated aspects of human life.
As multiplicity increases, our capacity to understand seems to shrink, and the urge to
bifurcate the human population into a constrictive binary system emerges.
Female or male, gay or straight, white or of color, abled or disabled&#x2026; These
designations are superficial perspectives of intricate and composite natural
phenomena, but our intuition struggles to conceive of them as diverse and
multifaceted<span class="footnote-mark"><a

class="cmti-10x-x-109">facts</span></em> and pursuing a solid depiction of <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">reality</span></em>,
philosopher of science Ronald <a 
 id="x1-2001"></a>Giere (<a 
href="#cite.0@Giere_2006">2006</a>) argues that scientific observation is always
perspectival, &#8220;always mediated by the nature of the instruments through which we
interact with selected aspects of reality&#8221;&#x00A0;(43). Knowledge is constructed through a
negotiation of scientific <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">models</span></em> composed of various methods, instruments, and
theoretical frameworks&#8212;incomplete and perspectival, but never detached
from their contextual use. Scientific <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">truth</span></em> is not absolute, but partial&#8212;a
representation of the world&#8212;yet always situational, any model fits a given
purpose. He does not reject reality in and of itself, but concedes that science
can never convey a singular objective truth superseding all context&#x00A0;(Giere
<a 
href="#cite.0@Giere_2006">2006</a>).
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   As Giere does, Paul <a 
 id="x1-2002"></a>Feyerabend (<a 
href="#cite.0@Feyerabend_1988">1988</a>) rejects scientific realism, but he radically
moves beyond a structural and pragmatic approach. He advocates for a theoretical
anarchism, &#8220;more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its
law-and-order alternatives&#x2026;. The only principle that does not inhibit progress is:
anything goes&#8221;&#x00A0;(5). Scientific theories are incommensurable; there is no unifying
methodological framework adequately suited to all scientific inquiry. Adherence
                                                                         

                                                                         
to a formalized scientific body stifles disagreement and impedes progress:
&#8220;Proliferation of theories is beneficial for science, while uniformity impairs its critical
power&#8221;&#x00A0;(5).
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   The history of science is not merely a collection of observations and conclusions.
Feyerabend too argues there are no &#8220;bare facts&#8221;&#8212;science is always chaotic, marked by
interpretations and &#8220;essentially ideational&#8221;: &#8220;Science will always be as complex,
chaotic, full of mistakes, and entertaining as the ideas it contains, and these ideas in
turn will be as complex, chaotic, full of mistakes, and entertaining as are the minds of
those who invented them&#8221;&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-2003"></a>11). It is political and not without colonial and
imperialist force: Ruling over knowledge that outlived generations&#8212;preserved through
oral tradition and <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">unorthodox</span></em> methodology. Western science is <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">exceptional</span></em>, and
when challenged, &#8220;it ceases to be an instrument of research and turns into
a (political) pressure group&#8221;&#x00A0;(3). Science is embedded and formalized in
institutions and intertwined with power: &#8220;A little brainwashing will go a long
way in making the history of science duller, simpler, more uniform, more
&#8216;objective&#8217; and more easily accessible to treatment by strict and unchangeable
rules&#8221;&#x00A0;(11)
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   In <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Black Feminist Thought</span></em>, Patricia Hill <a 
 id="x1-2004"></a>Collins (<a 
href="#cite.0@Collins_1990">1990</a>) raises the concept of
standpoint epistemology. Collins argues that Black women&#8217;s lived experience, shaped
by racial and patriarchal oppression, often intersected with class, sexuality and ability
status, substantiates a distinctive frame of reference. This particular standpoint is set
out to produce representational perspectives and knowledges otherwise dismissed and
excluded from academic discourse. She builds on Michel <a 
 id="x1-2005"></a>Foucault (<a 
href="#cite.0@Foucault_1980">1980</a>) and his
notion of <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">subjugated knowledge</span></em>, which is twofold: first, &#8220;blocs of historical
knowledge which were present but disguised within the body of functionalist and
systematising theory&#8221;, as well as &#8220;a whole set of knowledges that have been
disqualified as inadequate to their task or insufficiently elaborated&#8221;&#x00A0;(82).
Subjugated knowledge covers that which is established but deserving of critique,
and that which is underexposed, deserving of recognition and to be brought
forward.
</p><!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   For Collins (<a 
href="#cite.0@Collins_1990">1990</a>), &#8220;knowledge claims are evaluated by a community of experts
whose members represent the standpoints of the groups from which they originate&#8221;,
and &#8220;each community of experts must maintain its credibility as defined by
the larger group in which it is situated and from which it draws its basic,
taken-for-granted knowledge&#8221;&#x00A0;(203). She exposes two problems: both <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">new</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">knowledge claims</span></em> and the methodologies of claiming knowledge are subject to
evaluation and validation by an established scientific body that exists within a
larger epistemology. Collins emphatically reiterates that Black women have
                                                                         

                                                                         
historically been excluded from and &#8220;denigrated within white-male-controlled
academic institutions&#8221;&#x00A0;(217), and she stresses the importance of dialogue &#8220;as a
dimension of an Afrocentric feminist epistemology&#8221;&#x00A0;(214). She states that while
Black communities can formulate claims that challenge a pre-established
understanding of a white male community, &#8220;this community does not grant that
Black women scholars have competing knowledge claims based in another
knowledge validation process&#8221;&#x00A0;(204); a paradigm that perpetuates prevailing
perspectives by preventing criticism of what is disguised within the system as well
as obstructing recognition of what is insufficiently brought to attention. A
paradigm that ultimately reinforces the narratives deemed acceptable by a
dominant majority and that resists inquiry and investigation from without. While
Collins&#8217; reflections are foundational for a feminist epistemology of color, we
can draw from her perspectives to widen this intersectional approach within
feminism.

</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   To set the stage, through perspectival realism, Giere provides a pragmatic middle
ground between scientific realism and relativism, breaking away from objectivism
while still building on rigorous methods. Feyerabend illustrates that reality resists
methodological consistency. Alongside Collins, both scholars provide a critique of
unified scientific bodies and epistemic frameworks. Perspectivism and its partial
nature are central to all three authors, but Collins grounds theory in practice and
locates human lived experience in the center of knowledge. Evidently, this isn&#8217;t
a call for epistemic chaos or an endeavour to abandon scientific rigor, but
rather to remind ourselves that what counts as truth is always subjective and
relational, political and situated, perpetuated through power and employed
to wield it. The 1% is not just a statistical outlier, it is a site of conflict
and subordination, a place where dominant models fracture, and where new
knowledge can arise&#8212;<em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">human knowledge</span></em>. This text proceeds from the conviction
that all human life is equally valuable and deserving of dignity, that the full
realization of human rights for all is a moral imperative, and that unimpeded
discourse and epistemic negotiation are fundamental means to achieve this
aim.

female or male, and how we incorporate this marked difference in the world&#8212;several
models of perception are commonly utilized to propagate a simple, uniform and easily
accessible narative. Implicitly, but every story of the sexed body ultimately is a
descriptive model; a perspectival framework. Insisting on operating outside
or above any framework is an illusion, an appeal to tradition, nature, or
divinity.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   In 2021, the interpretation of &#8220;sex&#8221; in the UK under the Equality Act 2010 c. 15
(EA2010) in relation to the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act
2018 was challenged in the Scottish courts by the activist group For Women Scotland
(FWS). The legislation in question aimed to ensure equal sex representation
among non-executive members of public boards. FWS contested the provision
that expressly included transgender women as eligible under the statute.
The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court and in 2025, <em><span

<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Scotland Ltd v. The Scottish Ministers</span></em> [2025] UKSC 16 ruled in favor of the

EA2010, the protected categories of sex must be interpreted as &#8220;biological&#8221; and
not applied to the sex obtained through gender recognition certificates. The
word biological appears over 200 times in the 87-page judgment, but we
are left to speculate what it precisely entails. In paragraph 171, it is stated

learn to better understand these expressions of thought while expanding
our insight and capacity to appreciate ambivalence. This dissection is by no
means a proposition to arrange and structure thought patterns, but rather an
initative that hopes to foster greater awareness of the threats posed in this
rhetoric.

introducing gene sequences and regulatory networks. Of particular interest was the
identification of genes involved in sex development. This ultimately led to the key
breakthrough in 1990, with the discovery of the sex-determining region on the Y

Numerous other genes responsible for gonadal development have been described,

dosages and at precise times to produce functioning male and female gonads, and

each of these stages of development interwoven with intricate environmental factors,
that may or may not consistently result in what we intuitively perceive as male and
female differentiation.

Ironically, Montgomery&#8217;s account, written over a century ago, showed a more nuanced
comprehension of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors than dominant
perspectives that governed the majority of the 20th century. Assumptions
about sex difference were grounded in chromosomal, genetic, and hormonal
models that upheld a binary and normative view of biological sex, leaving
little room for natural variations. &#8220;An androcentric scientific environment
focused on the study of male sex development and perpetuated the notion of
a default and passive route to female sex development&#8221;&#x00A0;(Rehmann-Sutter

stereotypes central to our cultural definitions of male and female&#8221;&#x00A0;(103).
Throughout the history of biology, gametes have been cast in metaphor and infused
with meaning, anthropomorphically portrayed in a romanticized narrative:
depicting egg cells as <em><span

construct&#8212;while it provides a useful framework within the context of reproductive
biology, it also produces counter-intuitive classifications, such as seahorse male
pregnancy&#x00A0;(<a

<em><span

Implementation and enforcement of the proposed categorization is not feasible: people
born with ovaries will hopefully never be subjected to systematic high-risk
and costly biopsies to determine the presence of oocytes, sperm production
does not begin before puberty, and gamete production in people born with
atypical gonads is variable and oftentimes in contradiction with observed
characteristics&#x00A0;(<a

as well as several health conditions (citations) may halt the production of
gametes during a person&#8217;s lifetime&#8212;which makes it inherently mutable. To
circumvent this problem, the Trump administration decided to rely on the word
&#8220;sex&#8221; as a proxy: it symbolizes the <em><span

</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Binary and immutable are not interchangeable qualifiers; mutable properties can
live within a binary system, and immutable traits can be diverse. By conflating the
terms and interchanging them deliberately, it seems that we are not seeking to define
the sexed body as much as rebuking the fluidity of sex as a concept. Not
only challenging the variability, plasticity, and temporality of biology, but
negating the sexed body as a discursive field. Those who live below that
threshold are systematically dismissed when discourse is discarded. The very
existence of the threshold is trivialized. There is no space for discourse in
courts<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-21031f26"></a>,
legislative institutions and executive powers (citation) when they unilaterally defy the
fluidity of sex. It is crucial that we learn to identify the patterns of violence
inflicted on those living below that threshold. We must acknowledge that
our entitlement to open inquiry is actively denied through self-perpetuating
commonsensical thought and the imposed significance of the procreative
imperative.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   When it is said that <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">sex matters</span></em>, an assertion is made to reject gender as a
historically construed subject in favor of a stable depiction of the distinctions
that nature <em><span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">provides</span></em>&#8212;preceding all signification. However, once extracted
what is learned from that truth is then applied to structure society and to
objectify subjectivities, it seems that it is truly gender that matters. If gender
is what assigns meaning to the apparent qualities of sex, such sloganesque
expressions paradoxically disintegrate as they relocate themselves into the realm
of gender. This appeal to nature and its arrogance to determine destiny is
exactly what feminism has sought to scrutinize and dislodge from its historical
constraints.

</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   The first model asserts the narrative of an unarticulated essence, expressed
through biology but tacitly contained&#8212;through our own judgment, it is imbued with
meaning. The second model attempts to simplify that narrative and elucidates a
facticity conveyed within, often overlooking the shadows cast by its own clarity. The
third model casts the body from a rigid mold, modeled on the master pattern that
                                                                         

                                                                         
is male oppression; the course of life is preordained. So is the shape of the
body.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   This list is far from exhaustive, but these are the most prevalent essentialist
perspectives used to form a constrictive definition of sex. They are not distinct
tactics elegantly deployed to tackle the problem, but rather intermingled
methods conveniently alternated and engaged on demand to uphold prevailing
preconceptions&#8212;frequently at odds with one another. Nonetheless, proposing
formulations of improved models that better articulate intuitive understanding may
prove to be foolish&#8212;the inaccuracy and subjective nature inherently present in all
efforts made to discern sex may as well be understood as an opportunity for discourse
and possibility, rather than provoking contention and contempt. When ill-defined and
intuitive conceptions of embodied expression are codified into law, they become
mechanisms of coercion and disciplinary power, arbitrariness masquerading as
order.
