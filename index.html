<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Hydrogen and helium make up 99% of all observable matter in the universe&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-1001"></a><a 
href="#cite.0@CenterForAstrophysics">Center
for Astrophysics</a>, <a 
href="#cite.0@CenterForAstrophysics">n.d.</a>). The rest is just a deviation from the norm, anomalies we
shouldn&#8217;t account for. Sounds absurd? I guess Mendeleev was woke&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-1002"></a><a 
href="#cite.0@Mendeleev">Mendeleev.com</a>,
<a 
href="#cite.0@Mendeleev">n.d.</a>). When we try to understand the world around us, we are not simply observing
reality as it is: we are constructing and utilizing a model&#8212;a framework through
which we perceive, analyze, predict, and control our environment and the living
beings around and among us. In order to justify our beliefs, we draw from empirical
data, rationalize and hypothesize causation in relation to established insights; all
within a plural and intertwined historical project of knowledge building and
perception shaping. If we fail to admit that some models are ineffective for
understanding and describing certain phenomena within a given context, we&#8217;re not
helping ourselves in this project; we are simply reinforcing the narratives that we&#8217;ve
grown to accept throughout history, potentially doing real harm along the
way.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Certain qualities that appear to live on a singular dimension are given more
nuanced and spectral recognition than increasingly diverse topics. Take human age,
for example: humans are traditionally considered to be either minors, adults, or
seniors. We seem to agree that a transition from one category into another is merely
                                                                  

                                                                  
a traverse of an arbitrary mark, yet we can think of age in terms of a continuum to
which we&#8217;ve attached those milestones for the purpose of legal recognition and
ceremonial celebration. The underlying gradual nature of human aging is maintained,
while we do seem to value decimal divisions and lifecycle categories whenever the
context calls for it.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   Thus, we can conceive of a person&#8217;s age through a variety of models, depending
on the circumstances. Strangely enough, some properties like age, body weight, and
stature are typically not construed through a binary lens (citation). Whereas
diversity of racialized, gendered, or (dis)abled bodies seems much harder to grasp
as sophisticated aspects of human life. As variability becomes greater, our
capacity to understand seems to shrink, and the urge to bifurcate the human
population into a constrictive binary system&#8212;not even a spectrum&#8212;emerges.
Female or male, gay or straight, white or of color, abled or disabled&#x2026; These
designations are dumbed-down perspectives of intricate and composite natural
phenomena, but our intuition struggles to conceive of them as diverse and
multifaceted.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   When we are confronted with the question of the sexed body, what it means to be
female or male, and how we can incorporate this marked difference in the world,
several models of perception are commonly utilized&#8212;implicitly, but every story of the
sexed body ultimately is a descriptive model. Insisting on operating outside
or above any framework is an illusion, an appeal to tradition, nature, or
divinity.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   In 2021, the UK Supreme Court was called to deliberate on the interpretation of
sex in the context of The Equality Act 2010 (c. 15), in reference to the Gender
Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018. The final judgment, deliverid
in 2025, mentioned the word &#8220;biological&#8221; over 200 times in 87 pages. For Women
Scotland ([2025] UKSC 16) [171]:

     with the biological characteristics that make an individual a man or
     a woman. These are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require
     no further explanation.</p></blockquote>
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   The word &#8220;biological&#8221; is introduced by the court, and it&#8217;s hereby tasked to carry
the burden of <span 
class="cmti-10">plain and unambiguous </span>differentiation of bodies. Biologists oftentimes
disagree on the parameters of what they see as human sex (citation), but in that
disagreement lies potentiality. The court made a shameless appeal to tradition;
&#8220;biological&#8221; is <span 
class="cmti-10">self-explanatory</span>, explained by itself; by what is already known, thus
certainly not in need of new interpretations or revisions, no longer participating in
the ever-evolving process of collective epistemic advancement, stifling all
disagreement.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   While this judgment explicitly evaded any and all attempts to circumscribe sex,
many political leaders and public figures have overtly postulated constrictive
definitions, explanations, and meanings of the word &#8220;sex&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;woman&#8221; in particular. In
this text, I will lay out three popular essentialist perspectives, illustrated by
examples, old and new. I will demonstrate how they claim to reflect the <span 
class="cmti-10">truth</span>
                                                                  

                                                                  
and why they are limited in conveying human diversity. By differentiating
between &#8220;Mythical&#8221;, &#8220;Biological&#8221; and &#8220;Cultural&#8221; frameworks, we can learn to
better understand these expressions of thought while hopefully expanding our
curiosity and capacity to appreciate ambivalence. This exercise of dissection is
by no means an attempt to arrange and structure thought patterns, but
rather an initiative to gain insight from different angles, allowing for greater
understanding.

observed traits that allow us to <span

encapsulates the capacity to reproduce. Or at least, the expectation that
it <span 
class="cmti-10">should </span>have or <span

strength in its flexibility and its power through its perceived signification of a
reproductive teleology. It is the sexed body in <span

without resorting to circular definitions, but its boundaries are strict. So
strict that the merest glance at the nature of this spirit during the initial
seconds of life mandates an entire lifetime within the boundaries that it
imposes.

<a 
href="#cite.0@Oyewumi_1997">1997</a>). While initial recognition and categorization of sex typically occurs at the time
of birth and on the basis of observed external genitalia, it is speculated that the
remaining markers of sex will reveal themselves coherently in later stages of sexual
development. Perceived incongruence between these markers or divergence of
aesthetic conformity give rise to tension when they contradict the notion of nature&#8217;s
intended complementary design.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   The story of Herculine Barbin is one of the most famous histories of
intersex people. Born 1838 in France, she was initially assigned female at
birth. Although she was consistently perceived as a girl before puberty, she
experienced mockery and contempt for her appearance as a teenager. From her
memoirs:&#x00A0;&#8220;At that age, when all a woman&#8217;s graces unfold, I had neither
that free and easy bearing nor the well-rounded limbs that reveal youth
in full bloom. My complexion with its sickly pallor denoted a condition of
chronic ill health. My features had a certain hardness that one could not help
noticing. My upper lip and a part of my cheeks were covered by a light
down that increased as the days passed. Understandably, this peculiarity
often drew to me joking remarks that I tried to avoid by making frequent
use of scissors in place of a razor&#8221;&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-3010"></a>Barbin <a 
href="#cite.0@Barbin_1980">1980</a>, 26). At age 22, following
medical examinations, she was abruptly classified as male&#8212;strongly against her
will. She was barred from seeing her partner, and through enforced legal
sex reassignment, she was ousted from her job as a teacher in a boarding
school. She moved to Paris and adopted a male persona but she lived in
sorrow, rage and poverty, only to die by suicide at age 29. Alexina&#8212;the
name she used and identified with&#8212;saw herself as an &#8220;<span 
class="cmti-10">exceptional </span>female,
she did not perceive herself as necessarily beyond the boundaries of the
female&#8221;&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-3011"></a>Holmes <a

Michel Foucault&#x00A0;(Barbin <a

coverage in the studies of sex and gender, emerging as an intriguing subject of

that the SRY gene on the Y chromosome typically sets forth a complex

a semblance of sex chromosomes. They remain distinct aspects, and the
fact that we frequently rely on one to signify the other precisely illustrates
this, while at the same time highlighting the possibility of divergence. The
tradition of sex assignment predates our understanding of chromosomal sex by
several millennia (citation). The relatively recent invention of karyotyping and
earlier observations of sex chromosomes are scientific revelations part of an
ever evolving process subject to re-evaluation. Futhermore, they remain
observations of natural phenomena, in the same way that physical examinations

heap. But when we think of sand, we&#8217;re not <span 
class="cmti-10">moving </span>grains into the heaps
that we examine because the observer does not interfere. The taxonomy of
human sex does not only <span 
class="cmti-10">study </span>bodies and behavior. It exerts power over the
subjects of its own inquiry by perpetually reestablishing an assignment that
was initially never even consented to. For many, legal recognition of sex
reassignment is currently unattainable or existing rights are being eroded,
reparative conversion practices that coerce behavior and desire into conformity
still remain legal around the world. Despite efforts by the UN and WHO
to condemn such practices, they are even endorsed by some institutions.
Medical interventions are prohibited through state enforced bariers or coerced
without patient consent in order to sustain a binary harmony and uphold
the very same status quo that was initially invoked for the purpose of sex
assignment.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   Binary and immutable are not interchangeable qualifiers; mutable properties can
live within a binary system, and immutable traits can be diverse. By conflating the
terms and interchanging them deliberately, it seems that we are not seeking to define
the sexed body as much as rebuking the fluidity of sex as a concept. Not
only challenging the variability, plasticity, and temporality of biology, but
negating the sexed body as a discursive field. Those who live below that
threshold are systematically dismissed when discourse is discarded. The very
existence of the threshold is trivialized. There is no space for discourse in
courts<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-6001f7"></a>,
legislative institutions and executive powers when they unilaterally defy the fluidity
of sex. It is crucial that we learn to identify the patterns of violence inflicted on those
living below that threshold. We must acknowledge that our entitlement to open
inquiry is actively denied through self-perpetuating commonsensical thought and the
imposed signification of a procreative prospect.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   When it is said that <span 
class="cmti-10">sex matters</span>, an assertion is made to reject gender as a
historically construed subject in favor of a stable depiction of the distinctions that
nature <span 
class="cmti-10">provides </span>us&#8212;preceding all signification. However, once extracted
what is learned from that truth is then applied to structure society and to
objectify subjectivities, it seems that it is truly gender that matters. If gender is
what assigns meaning to the apparent qualities of sex, such sloganesque
expressions paradoxically disintegrate as they relocate themselves into the realm of
gender. This appeal to nature and its arrogance to determine destiny is
exactly what feminism has sought to scrutinize and dislodge from its historical
constraints.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >The first model asserts the narrative of an unarticulated essence, expressed through
biology but tacitly contained&#8212;through our own judgment, it is imbued with
meaning. The second model attempts to simplify that narrative and elucidates a
facticity conveyed within, often overlooking the shadows cast by its own clarity. The
third model casts the body from a rigid mold, modeled on the master pattern that is
male oppression; the course of life is preordained. So is the shape of the
body.
</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   This list is far from exhaustive, but these are the most prevalent essentialist
perspectives used to form a constrictive definition of sex. They are not distinct
tactics elegantly deployed to tackle the problem, but rather intermingled
methods conveniently alternated and engaged on demand to uphold prevailing
preconceptions&#8212;frequently at odds with one another. Nonetheless, proposing
formulations of improved models that better articulate intuitive understanding may
prove to be foolish&#8212;the inaccuracy and subjective nature inherently present in all
efforts made to discern sex may as well be understood as an opportunity for discourse
and possibility, rather than provoking contention and contempt. When ill-defined and
intuitive conceptions of embodied expression are codified into law, they become
mechanisms of coercion and disciplinary power, arbitrariness masquerading as
order.
