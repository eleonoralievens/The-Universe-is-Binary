reality as it is: we are constructing and utilizing models, frameworks and
paradigms through which we perceive, analyze, predict, and control our
environment and the living beings around and among us. In order to justify our
beliefs, we draw from empirical data, rationalize and hypothesize causation in
relation to established insights; all within a plural and intertwined historical

admit that some perspectives are ineffective for understanding and describing
certain phenomena within a given context, we&#8217;re not helping ourselves in this
project; we are simply reinforcing the narratives that we&#8217;ve grown to accept
throughout history&#8212;potentially doing real harm along the way&#x00A0;(<a

</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Certain qualities that appear to live on a singular dimension receive more
nuanced and spectral recognition than more complicated topics. Take human age, for
example; &#8220;we tend to view age as a series of discrete categories, rather than as a
continuous distribution. Categories such as infant, baby, child, adolescent,
teenager, young adult, adult, middle-age, old age, elderly would seem to be the
most common, but we can easily think of further subdivisions&#8221;&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-1007"></a>Giles and
Reid <a 
href="#cite.0@Giles_2005">2005</a>). We may perceive of others as young or old in reference to our
own age, or think in terms of minor, adult, senior in legal settings, but we
typically seem to understand that transitioning from one category into another
is merely a crossing of an arbitrary mark. The underlying dimensional or
gradual understaning of human aging is maintained, while we do seem to value
decimal divisions and lifecycle categories whenever the situation calls for
it.
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Thus, we can conceive of age through a variety of perspectives and representational
models, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, some properties like age, body
weight, and stature are typically not construed through a binary lens, in favor of
prototypical or normative structures&#x00A0;(<a 
 id="x1-1008"></a>Cash <a 
href="#cite.0@Cash_2002">2002</a>). Whereas diversity of racialized,
gendered, or (dis)abled bodies seems much harder to grasp as sophisticated aspects of
human life. As multiplicity increases, our capacity to understand seems to shrink, and
the urge to bifurcate the human population into constrictive binary systems emerges.
Female or male, gay or straight, white or of color, abled or disabled&#x2026; These
designations are dumbed-down perspectives of intricate and composite natural
phenomena, but our intuition struggles to conceive of them as diverse and

be female or male, and how we incorporate this marked difference in the
world&#8212;several models of perception are commonly utilized; implicitly, but every
story of the sexed body ultimately is a descriptive model. Insisting on operating
outside or above any framework is an illusion, an appeal to tradition, nature, or
divinity.

Women Scotland (FWS). The legislation in question aimed to ensure equal sex
representation among non-executive members of public boards. FWS contested the
provision that expressly included transgender women as eligible under the
statute. The case ultimately reached the UK Supreme Court and in 2025,
<em><span

the protected categories of sex must be interpreted as &#8220;biological&#8221; and not
applied to the sex obtained through gender recognition certificates. The
word &#8220;biological&#8221; appears over 200 times in the 87-page judgment, but we
are left to speculate what it precisely entails. In paragraph 171, it is stated
that:

participating in the ever-evolving process of collective epistemic advancement, stifling
all disagreement.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   While the Supreme Court judgment explicitly evaded any and all attempts to
circumscribe sex, many political leaders and public figures have overtly postulated
constrictive definitions, explanations, and meanings of the word &#8220;sex&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221;
in particular. In this text, I will lay out three popular essentialist perspectives,
illustrated by examples, old and new. I will demonstrate how they claim to reflect the
<em><span

better understand these expressions of thought while hopefully expanding our
curiosity and capacity to appreciate ambivalence. This dissection is by no
means an attempt to arrange and structure thought patterns, but rather an
initiative to gain insight from differing angles, hopefully fostering greater
awareness.

karyotype. Beyond the observed traits that allow us to <i><span

strength in its flexibility and its power through its perceived signification of a
reproductive teleology. It is the sexed body in <i><span

without resorting to circular definitions, but its boundaries are strict. So
strict that the merest glance at the nature of this spirit during the initial

attempts to outline womanhood, building on a more comprehensive list of

of birth and on the basis of observed external genitalia, it is speculated that the
remaining markers of sex will reveal themselves coherently in later stages of sexual
development. Perceived incongruence between these markers or divergence of
aesthetic conformity give rise to tension when they contradict the notion of nature&#8217;s
intended complementary design.

sickly pallor denoted a condition of chronic ill health. My features had a
certain hardness that one could not help noticing. My upper lip and a part of
my cheeks were covered by a light down that increased as the days passed.

</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Binary and immutable are not interchangeable qualifiers; mutable properties can
live within a binary system, and immutable traits can be diverse. By conflating the
terms and interchanging them deliberately, it seems that we are not seeking to define
the sexed body as much as rebuking the fluidity of sex as a concept. Not
only challenging the variability, plasticity, and temporality of biology, but
negating the sexed body as a discursive field. Those who live below that
threshold are systematically dismissed when discourse is discarded. The very
existence of the threshold is trivialized. There is no space for discourse in
courts<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-6029f12"></a>,
legislative institutions and executive powers (citation) when they unilaterally defy
the fluidity of sex. It is crucial that we learn to identify the patterns of violence
inflicted on those living below that threshold. We must acknowledge that our
entitlement to open inquiry is actively denied through self-perpetuating
commonsensical thought and the imposed significance of the procreative
imperative.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   When it is said that <em><span 
class="cmti-10">sex matters</span></em>, an assertion is made to reject gender as a
historically construed subject in favor of a stable depiction of the distinctions
that nature <em><span 
class="cmti-10">provides</span></em>&#8212;preceding all signification. However, once extracted
what is learned from that truth is then applied to structure society and to
objectify subjectivities, it seems that it is truly gender that matters. If gender is
what assigns meaning to the apparent qualities of sex, such sloganesque
expressions paradoxically disintegrate as they relocate themselves into the realm of
gender. This appeal to nature and its arrogance to determine destiny is
exactly what feminism has sought to scrutinize and dislodge from its historical
constraints.

</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   The first model asserts the narrative of an unarticulated essence, expressed
through biology but tacitly contained&#8212;through our own judgment, it is imbued with
meaning. The second model attempts to simplify that narrative and elucidates a
facticity conveyed within, often overlooking the shadows cast by its own clarity. The
third model casts the body from a rigid mold, modeled on the master pattern that is
male oppression; the course of life is preordained. So is the shape of the
body.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   This list is far from exhaustive, but these are the most prevalent essentialist
perspectives used to form a constrictive definition of sex. They are not distinct
tactics elegantly deployed to tackle the problem, but rather intermingled
methods conveniently alternated and engaged on demand to uphold prevailing
preconceptions&#8212;frequently at odds with one another. Nonetheless, proposing
formulations of improved models that better articulate intuitive understanding may
prove to be foolish&#8212;the inaccuracy and subjective nature inherently present in all
efforts made to discern sex may as well be understood as an opportunity for discourse
and possibility, rather than provoking contention and contempt. When ill-defined and
intuitive conceptions of embodied expression are codified into law, they become
mechanisms of coercion and disciplinary power, arbitrariness masquerading as
order.
